# JAVA IO

### Streams -
 -  Abstraction between physical device and Java, that either produces or consumes information.
 -  Two types:
    - ### Byte Streams - Data in binary format
      1. BufferedInputStream - Buffered input stream
      2. BufferedOutputStream - Buffered Output stream
      3. BufferedArrayInputStream - Input Stream that reads from a byte array.
      4. BufferedArrayOutputStream - Output Stream that writes to a byte array.
      5. DataInputStream - Contains method to read Java Standard types.
      6. DataOutputStream - Contains methods to write to Java Standard types.
      7. FileInputStream - Input Stream that reads from a file.
      8. FileOutputStream - Output Stream that writes to a file.
      9. FilterInputStream - Implements InputStream
      10. FilterOutputStram - Implements OutputStream
      11. InputStream - Abstract class that describes stream input.
      12. ObjectInputStream - Input stream for objects.
      13. ObjectOutputStream - Output Stream for objects.
      14. PipedInputStream - Input Pipe
      15. PipedOutputStream - Output Pipe
      16. PrintStream - Output stream that contains print() and println().
      17. PushbackInputStream - Input stream that allows bytes to be returned to input stream.
